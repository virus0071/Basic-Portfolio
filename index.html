    <div id="intro">
      <p>My name is Nan Wu, and I am from China. I am interested in computer science and business. Therefore, I chose the former as my undergraduate major. After that, I came to the U.S. to get further education. I have earned an MBA degree and a master of science in information system degree.
        </p>

    <p>During leisure time, I like playing basketball, swimming and calligraphy. For the latter two, I practiced for more than 5 years when I was a child. Till now, I still keep them as regular activities. On one hand, swimming makes me release energy in my body. On the other hand, calligraphy can peace my mind, and allow me to think about Zen of everything. This is what I do when I have challenge in coding. I would like to make new friends in this class.
